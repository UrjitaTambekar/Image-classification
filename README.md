The utilization of electrical devices, such as tubelight,fans in educational settings like classrooms and laboratories contributes significantly to energy consumption. However, these devices often remain powered on even when not in active use, leading to unnecessary energy wastage. The "Switch Off Devices When Not in Use" project aims to send message to power off idle devices in classrooms and labs. 
                            Unlike traditional methods that rely on manual reminders and periodic checks, this project utilizes sensors and automated systems to detect instances of energy waste, such as devices left powered on unnecessarily. By sending targeted messages only when energy waste occurs, the system prompts users to switch off devices and actively participate in energy conservation efforts. This proactive approach not only addresses the challenge of energy wastage more effectively but also fosters a culture of sustainability and responsibility among students, faculty, and staff.
                 The proposed system works like a smart detective for energy waste in classrooms. It uses special image of classrooms or lab with the help of CCTV Camera.When it notices a device left on for no reason, it sends a friendly message to the user, like a reminder, asking them to turn it off. This way, the system helps people remember to save energy without bothering them when they're using the devices properly. It's like having a helpful friend watching out for unnecessary energy use to keep things eco-friendly and cost-effective.
